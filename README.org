*** Usage
    -Many, if not all aspects, are configurable in the commented [[https://github.com/xaccrocheur/kituu/blob/master/.bashrc][.bashrc]] file ; It's also meant to be as secure as possible and avoids exporting crap in your env. Many surprises as well. I spent some time on this one. Bug reports *welcome*

    -Use this little [[file:scripts/list-shell-colours.sh][script]] to help you find your colors but stick to the ASCII ones if you're going to use your .bashrc on weird old crusty machines, like I do.

    -If you defined custom paths and aliases in your existing .bashrc, don't forget to source them in the new one. Always keep a backup.

    -Use the force, read the source ;)

    NOTE: this .bashrc only works with UTF-8 capable terminal emulators.

    -Don't forget that in BASH, [[http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-emacs-editing-mode-cheat-sheet/][you're already in Emacs]] !
